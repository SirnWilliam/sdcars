						“Just purchased and traded in a car with SD Cars, it was by far the easiest and one, if not the, best experiences I've ever had purchasing a car. Hanna, Jared, Stephen, Brittnee and the gentleman who deliver my car went above and beyond. I would highly recommend!”<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

						“At 10:02 AM on Friday I bought a car from SDCars.com. I uploaded all my forms, I electronically signed all the papers, and was approved for financing without ever speaking to a human. At 10:07 AM on Saturday they delivered the car to my door. 24 hours, no sales person, no hassle, no price haggling. If you are in the San Diego area looking for a used car you should be looking here before anywhere else.”

						“I JUST got my new Mitsubishi Endeavor delivered. It is fabulous! The entire process is amazing, smooth and painless. The people at SD Cars have been wonderful to work with and were very helpful. I felt Stephen when out of his way to answer my questions and help me through the process. I have a fear of going to car dealerships. I had NO fear working with SD Cars. I am super excited about my new car and can't wait to showcase and tell everybody about SD Cars!”
